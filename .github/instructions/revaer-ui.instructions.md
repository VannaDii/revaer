# First-Party Vs Vendor Paths

- First-party authored UI quality targets are:
  - `crates/revaer-ui/src/**`
  - `crates/revaer-ui/i18n/**`
  - `crates/revaer-ui/tools/asset_sync/src/**`
  - `tests/**` excluding generated or installed dependencies
- Generated or vendored paths are not first-party authored UI code:
  - `crates/revaer-ui/ui_vendor/**`
  - `crates/revaer-ui/static/nexus/**`
  - `crates/revaer-ui/dist/**`
  - `crates/revaer-ui/dist-serve/**`
  - `crates/revaer-ui/target/**`
  - `tests/node_modules/**`
  - `tests/logs/**`
  - `tests/test-results/**`
- Do not hand-edit vendored or generated assets unless the task is explicitly about vendor ingestion, asset synchronization, or generated output shape.

# UI Architecture

- `app/*` is the only layer that touches browser globals, storage, router providers, or `EventSource`.
- `core/*` stays DOM-free and host-testable.
- `services/*` is transport-only. Convert DTOs into feature state before they reach UI views.
- `features/*` owns vertical slices. Features do not reach into each other directly.
- `components/*` hosts shared UI building blocks only. No persistence, API calls, or SSE side effects inside shared components.
- `models.rs` contains transport DTOs only. UI-only fields live in feature state.

# UI And E2E Maintenance

- Keep selectors and test affordances stable. Update E2E fixtures deliberately when UI structure changes.
- Treat generated API clients and synchronized assets as generated artifacts; regenerate them intentionally and keep authored wrappers separate.
- CI E2E should use an explicit browser channel such as `E2E_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` when the runner already provides that browser, so shards install Playwright dependencies without downloading redundant browser bundles.
- When UI structure, selectors, or synced assets change, update the relevant docs, tests, and instructions in the same change.

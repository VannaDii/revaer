# AGENT.MD — Codex Operating Instructions (Revaer, Rust 2024)

> **Prime Directives**
>
> 1. **Rust 2024 only**. Never lower the edition.
> 2. **No dead code**. No unused items, no future stubs, no parking-lot code.
> 3. **Minimal dependencies**. Prefer `std`; every new dependency needs written rationale.
> 4. **The Justfile is law**. Local and CI build/test/lint/release gates run through [`justfile`](./justfile).
> 5. **Stored procedures or bust**. Runtime database access goes through stored procedures; raw SQL belongs only in migrations and tightly scoped operational bootstrap scripts.
> 6. **Deterministic, panic-free production code**. No `panic!`, `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `unreachable!()`, or silent error suppression in authored production or bootstrap code.
> 7. **No source-level lint suppressions**. `#[allow(...)]` and `#[expect(...)]` are not permitted in authored code.
> 8. **`just ci` and `just ui-e2e` before every hand-off**. A task is not complete until both pass cleanly.
> 9. **Dependencies are injected**. Runtime logic receives collaborators from callers; only bootstrap/wiring code constructs concrete implementations or reads the environment.
>
> **Completion Rule:** Because Codex runs locally, a task is complete only when all requirements in this file and the scoped instruction files are satisfied, `just ci` passes without warnings or errors, and `just ui-e2e` passes.

## 0) Policy Precedence And Source Of Truth

- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) is the non-negotiable root contract.
- Scoped instruction files under [`.github/instructions/`](./.github/instructions/) may only tighten or specialize the root contract for their matching paths. They may not relax root policy.
- If two instruction files appear to conflict, precedence is:
  1. [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)
  2. the most specific scoped instruction file
  3. supporting docs and ADRs
- Operational source-of-truth files are:
  - [`justfile`](./justfile)
  - [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - [`.github/workflows/pr.yml`](./.github/workflows/pr.yml)
  - [`.github/workflows/sonar.yml`](./.github/workflows/sonar.yml)
  - [`sonar-project.properties`](./sonar-project.properties)
- This file must reference those operational files instead of copying large command bodies or stale workflow inventories.
- Current scoped instruction files:
  - [`.github/instructions/rust.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/rust.instructions.md)
  - [`.github/instructions/revaer-data.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/revaer-data.instructions.md)
  - [`.github/instructions/revaer-ui.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/revaer-ui.instructions.md)
  - [`.github/instructions/ffi.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/ffi.instructions.md)
  - [`.github/instructions/devops.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/devops.instructions.md)
  - [`.github/instructions/sonarqube_mcp.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/sonarqube_mcp.instructions.md)

## 1) Repository Invariants

- Keep the repo library-first. Binaries are thin bootstrap/wiring layers; reusable logic lives in library crates.
- Keep the public API small. Use `pub(crate)` by default and expose cross-crate items intentionally.
- Runtime database access uses stored procedures only. No runtime inline SQL outside the migration/operational exceptions called out in scoped instructions.
- `JSONB` and other conglomerate persistence formats are banned for application state. Persist normalized data.
- Runtime collaborators are injected. Do not read environment variables or construct concrete infra implementations inside domain logic.
- Zero dead code is mandatory. If code ships, it is exercised in production, tests, or an explicitly exercised feature configuration.
- Advisory ignores are forbidden by default: [`.secignore`](./.secignore), the advisory-ignore list in [`deny.toml`](./deny.toml), and npm audit exceptions must remain empty. Cargo and npm findings at every configured severity are mandatory fixes. Any exception requires explicit operator consent recorded in the task ADR, an expiry, and a guardrail change in the same commit. Exact duplicate-crate tolerances in `deny.toml` must be ADR-backed, time-bounded, and removed as soon as the graph can converge.

---

## 2) Authored Code Quality Posture

- Edition and MSRV are pinned by [`Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml) and [`rust-toolchain.toml`](./rust-toolchain.toml). Keep them aligned.
- Treat warnings as errors across the workspace. Do not weaken lint posture in source or ad hoc commands.
- Authored production and bootstrap code must not panic. Return errors explicitly and terminate cleanly at the top-level boundary.
- Silent error suppression is forbidden. Handle, translate, or propagate every fallible operation.
- Log errors at their origin point once. Do not re-log the same error as it travels up the call chain.
- `Option<T>` is allowed only for legitimate absence semantics or partial-function domains where `None` is the complete, expected result.
- `Result<T, E>` is required for recoverable failure. Do not hide failure in `Option`, booleans, sentinel values, or logs.
- `std::panic::catch_unwind` is forbidden everywhere except documented FFI boundary shims covered by [`.github/instructions/ffi.instructions.md`](./.github/instructions/ffi.instructions.md).
- If a rule cannot be satisfied cleanly, redesign, split, delete, or isolate the code behind the documented FFI boundary. Do not silence the rule.

---

## 3) Quality Gates

- All local and CI operations run through `just` recipes. Workflows may install tools or stage artifacts, but build/test/lint/release gates must call `just`.
- Handoff requires:
  - `just ci`
  - `just ui-e2e`
- [`justfile`](./justfile) is the canonical command surface for build, lint, test, coverage, release, docs, and local dev loops.
- [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml), [`pr.yml`](./.github/workflows/pr.yml), and [`sonar.yml`](./.github/workflows/sonar.yml) must stay aligned with the Justfile and this policy.
- Sonar analysis scope and first-party signal shaping are versioned in [`sonar-project.properties`](./sonar-project.properties). Keep PR quality-gate behavior and new-code policy aligned with that file.

---

## 4) Maintainability Guardrails

- Keep one canonical statement of each global rule. Root policy belongs here; scoped files should reference it and add path-specific details instead of repeating or rewording it inconsistently.
- Any change to [`justfile`](./justfile), workflow files, release scripts, lint posture, or [`sonar-project.properties`](./sonar-project.properties) must update the relevant instruction file in the same change.
- Review the instruction set whenever crate layout, workflow layout, release flow, or quality gates change materially.
- Keep user-facing docs, examples, and generated API/reference artifacts in sync when exposed surfaces change.

---

## 5) Task Record And ADR Rules

- Every task persists a task record alongside the change as an ADR under [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/).
- Start from [`docs/adr/template.md`](./docs/adr/template.md), number sequentially, and keep the file name concise and searchable.
- Architectural decisions use `Proposed` until the operator gives explicit, decision-specific approval. Only then may the ADR use `Accepted`, and its operator-approval field must record the approval evidence and date.
- Completed nonarchitectural task records use `Recorded` with `Operator approval: Not applicable: nonarchitectural task record`. `Recorded` documents completed corrective work; it does not imply an architectural decision or operator approval.
- `Superseded` identifies a record replaced by a later ADR and must name the replacement. Do not use status changes to imply approval that was not given.
- Every task record must include:
  - Motivation
  - Design notes
  - Test coverage summary
  - Observability updates
  - Risk and rollback plan
  - Dependency rationale
  - Stale-policy check
- The stale-policy check must record:
  - which instruction files were reviewed
  - whether drift was found
  - which contradictions or stale references were removed
- Update [`docs/adr/index.md`](./docs/adr/index.md) and [`docs/SUMMARY.md`](./docs/SUMMARY.md) in the same change that adds the ADR.
